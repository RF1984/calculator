# Calculator

In this task you are to implement the functionality for a simple calculator. You have been given template html and css in the folder calculator_template but as you will notice, clicking the buttons does nothing. Your task is to add javascript code so that

the buttons do as expected (like a normal calculator). This will require you to learn how to traverse/select elements from the DOM-tree and handle their values. Functionality should be added for all buttons.
